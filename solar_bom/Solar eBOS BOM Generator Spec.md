### 2.5 String-to-Inverter Wiring Configuration

#### Routing Modes

The system supports two distinct routing calculation modes:

1. **Realistic Routing Mode**:
   - Cable routes follow actual installation patterns
   - Routes along tracker centerlines and torque tubes
   - Accounts for physical tracker structure
   - Provides accurate cable length calculations for BOM
   - Whip points align with harness cables for optimal installation
   - More accurate representation of field installation practices

2. **Conceptual Routing Mode**:
   - Simplified routing for visualization purposes
   - Direct point-to-point connections with minimal waypoints
   - Faster calculation and rendering
   - Suitable for preliminary design and understanding system topology
   - May not reflect actual installation cable lengths

#### Wire Routing Rules

- All cable routes follow a vertical-then-horizontal pattern in conceptual mode
- Realistic mode routes follow tracker structure and centerlines
- Maintain visual separation between parallel cable runs
- Route cables along tracker edges with appropriate offsets
- Positive cables route along left side of tracker, negative along right
- Routes determined by source point location relative to destination

#### Wire Harness Collection Points

- Node points placed near string source points with calculated offsets
- Node points follow positioning rules based on routing mode
- Each tracker maintains independent harness system with optional grouping
